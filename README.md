# Goldstack Sample Next.js Project 

This is a sample Next.js project using the [Goldstack Open Source libraries](https://github.com/goldstack/goldstack-lib#goldstack-template-framework).

âš  Note that this project may not use the latest version of libraries and configurations. To generate a starter project with the latest updates, please go to [goldstack.party](https://goldstack.party).

The root of the project contains configuration shared across modules as well as various utility scripts for applying operations for all modules.

You can find the modules you have selected in the folder `packages/`.

## Notes

### Max ListenersExceededWarning on `compile:watch` command

When running the `compile:watch` command in the root, you may get the following warning:

    (node:97874) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 SIGINT listeners added to [process]. Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit

This is nothing to worry about. It is caused by the command spawning a lot of subprocesses, since an individuall `nodemon` process is started for every package that is watched (see also [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9768444/possible-eventemitter-memory-leak-detected) on stackoverflow.
